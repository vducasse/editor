 * the wall shorter, never taller, and no gap can open at the top of a
 * level. A wall WITH `height` is an explicit exception (half wall,
 * parapet) and keeps the legacy semantics: the top rides a raised elected
 * base (`electedBase + height`), while a zero or sunken slab base leaves
 * the top at `height` (the legacy negative-slab constraint). Explicit
 * ground-hosted walls are the terrain exception: `height` is always body
 * height, including below datum, so sculpting cannot stretch the wall.
 *
 * Returns the top in level-local Y (same frame as `electedBase`).

 * elected base (`baseSegments`) is a geometry detail the extruder handles
 * separately and never changes where the top sits.

 * mesh origin (which sits at `electedBase`). May be non-positive when a
 * slab reaches the storey plane; callers own the degenerate-geometry
